# LA-Traffic-Collision-Analysis

<div align="justify">
One of the leading causes of injuries and fatalities globally is traffic accidents. Consequently, they make up a substantial area of research. A number of factors increase the likelihood of crashes including weather, road design, vehicle design, alcohol use and aggressive driving. In addition to these considerations, there can be some underlying patterns in the time of collision. A time series analysis can be used to uncover this underlying pattern. The purpose of this project is to predict the number of collisions using the time series analysis.

## DATASET
<div align="justify">
The dataset is taken from the open data portal city of Los Angeles. This data set and a bunch of others) is actively maintained by the city of Los Angeles and is freely available to the public. The dataset reflects traffic collision incidents in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2010. This is transcribed from original paper traffic reports, so itâ€™s very likely that there are errors. The data begins in January 2010 and is updated weekly. In this particular project, we used data from January 2010 to January 2021, which ends up being ~551K rows and 18 columns. Each row corresponds to a collision.
